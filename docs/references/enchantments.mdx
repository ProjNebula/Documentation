# Enchantments

Enchantments are applied to an item using the `<enchantment>` tag, or nested under a parent `<enchantments>` tag.

```xml
<item amount="1" material="iron pickaxe" slot="0">
  <enchantments>
    <enchantment level="1">dig speed</enchantment> <!-- Efficiency I applied to Iron Pickaxe -->
  </enchantments>
</item>
```

Atlas allows enchantments to be applied to any item regardless if the enchant was intended for it or not.
