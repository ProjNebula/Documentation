# Destroyable Phases `<phases>`

This module is used to automatically change the blocks of (and needed to repair) Destroyable objectives based on a delay and check.

## Phase `<phase>`

A phase is a step in the progession of different materials for a destroyable objective.

```xml

<phases countdown-message="{phases.transition}" fail-message="{phases.cores.fail}">
  <phase id="gold" success-message="{phases.core.gold}" delay="25m" pass-phase="glass">...</phase>
  <!--Gold Core Phase-->
</phases>

```

##### Phase Attributes

| `countdown-message` | The message that is used for the countdown that is displayed in chat and on the boss bar.  FORMAT: {0} = the name of the phase, {1} = the amount of time until the phase will be applied. | `Localized String` | |

### Find/Replace `<materials>`

```xml

<phases countdown-message="{phases.transition}" fail-message="{phases.cores.fail}">
  <phase id="gold" success-message="{phases.core.gold}" delay="25m" pass-phase="glass">
    <materials>
      <material find="obsidian" replace="gold block" />
      <!--Replace Obsidian with Gold Block-->
    </materials>
  </phase>
</phases>

```
