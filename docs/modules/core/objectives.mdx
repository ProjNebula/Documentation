# Objectives `<objectives>`

Objectives are the main way that a match winner is decided. They must be completed by a team to win, and sometimes have an owner who must protect the objective from other competitors.

## Destroyables and Leakables `<leakable>``<leakables>``<monument>``<monuments>`

Destroyable objectives count as any objective that must be completed by breaking blocks in a specified region.

Leakable objectives count as any container of blocks that contain a liquid that must be leaked out of the bottom in order for the objective to be marked as completed.

| Specification | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0.2 | Objective repair rules are now ignored by default. |
