# Groups `<ffa>``<teams>`

This module is used to define how many and what attributes teams should possess in the match.

Note that the team name is not an attribute but rather is defined as text within the element. Team names should be localized, short, and easy to remember.

## FFA `<ffa>`

When FFA is enabled, players are placed onto their own teams and optionally assigned different colors.

```xml

<ffa min="4" max="32" />

```

##### FFA Attributes

| `min` | The minimum number of players playing for the match to start. | `Number (Without Decimal)` | |
| `max` | The soft maximum number of players allowed in the match. Premium users and staff are able to join beyond this value. | `Number (Without Decimal)` | |
| `max-overfill` | The maximum number of players allowed in the match. | `Number (Without Decimal)` | `1.25 * max` |
| `colorize` | If each player should be assigned their own color out of all of the possible team colors. | `True/False` | `true` |
| `friendly-fire` | If players can hit each other. | `True/False` | `true` |

## Teams `<team>`

Teams represent groups of players in the match with a specific color.

```xml
