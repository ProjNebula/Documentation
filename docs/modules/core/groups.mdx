# Groups `<ffa>` `<teams>`

This module is used to define how many and what attributes teams should possess in the match.

Note that the team name is not an attribute but rather is defined as text within the element. Team names should be localized, short, and easy to remember.

## FFA `<ffa>`

When FFA is enabled, players are placed onto their own teams and optionally assigned different colors.

```xml

<ffa min="4" max="32" />

```
