# XML Includes `<include>`

Includes are used to split a large and redundant configuration file into multiple smaller files. `<include>` elements should only be found directly as a child of the main `<map>` element.

##### Shared Includes

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| defaults.xml | 
    Included in every map
    This loads localization for maps.
    DON'T DELETE THIS!
 |
| Shared/groups.xml | 
    Shared file loaded for all maps that contains useful groups or "snippets" of code that is used in a lot of maps.
    This is different from a regular include file because it can contain a wide variety of different feature definitions which can span a
    variety of gamemodes and that are only loaded by the respective map's XML file directly.
    Larger things that span multiple modules should generally receive their own include file.
    The goal of this file if to cut down on excess code duplication and make it easy to change things in Atlas without having to change a lot of XMLs.
