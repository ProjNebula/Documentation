# Compasses `<compasses>`

This module is used to customize where a player's compass points based on various conditions.

If multiple compasses are defined, checks will be used to determine which target is assigned to each player.

## Compass `<compass>`

```xml

<compasses>
  <!-- Sets compass to nearest player who has gold. -->
  <!-- If no players have gold the compass will point to the location. -->
  <compass target="enemy" check="has-gold" />
  s
  <compass target="1,1,1" />
</compasses>

<checks>
  <carrying id="has-gold" material="gold ingot" />
</checks>

```
