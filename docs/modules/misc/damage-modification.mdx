# Damage Modification `<modify-damage>`

This module is used to modify the amount of damage caused by an action based on a check.

## Modifier `<mod>`

This represents a check in relation to a damage type with a modifer and number action.

A specific damage type or `all` can be used to match all damage events.

```xml

<modify-damage>
  <mod mod="300" action="set">fall</mod>
  <!-- Fall damage is always deadly -->
</modify-damage>

```
