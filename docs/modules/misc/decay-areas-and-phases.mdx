# Decay Areas and Phases `<decay>`

This module is used to make blocks change phases under players and eventually fall at the specified time.

## Decay Area `<area>`

These represent areas of the map that the decay module should work inside of.

```xml

<decay>
  <area region="bridges" fall-delay="3s">
    <phase delay="1s">redstone block</phase>
    <phase delay="1s">dropper</phase>
    <phase delay="1s">piston base</phase>
    <phase delay="1s">piston sticky base</phase>
    <phase delay="1s">tnt</phase>
  </area>
</decay>

```

##### Decay Area Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `region` | The region that the block decay should act inside of. This can either be in ID form, or as a nested XML tag in the syntax of a region. | `Region` | |
| `fall-delay` | Time after the last phase completes before the blocks should turn into falling sand. This attribute denotes a period of time and can either be in seconds or in a period format. Formats are as follows:     d - days     h - hours     m - minutes     s - seconds These can be combined to create any period. No spaces are allowed. | `Duration` | `4` |

### Decay Phase `<phase>`

These denote materials that the blocks will change into in order before falling.

```xml

<phase delay="1s">redstone block</phase>

<phase delay="1s">dropper</phase>

<phase delay="1s">piston base</phase>

<phase delay="1s">piston sticky base</phase>

<phase delay="1s">tnt</phase>

```

#### Element Text

| Description | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Material of the phase. A material is defined in the syntax of matname:damage when matname is the name of the material and damage is the damage value of the material. A damage value is not required. | `Singular Material Matcher` |

##### Decay Phase Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `delay` | How long this phase should last before the next phase is applied. This attribute denotes a period of time and can either be in seconds or in a period format. | `Duration` | `3` |
