# Results `<results>`

The results module can be used to determine how and when a match should end, and how the winner should be decided.

## End Scenarios

Scenarios are what course Atlas will take to determine a winner of a match. There are currently only 2 supported scenario results.

```xml

<!-- Red will win 50% of the time the check is performed. (Check is performed 20 times a second) -->

<win scenario="team" team="red">
  <sometimes />
</win>

```
